# ==================================
# Notes from bootstraping Python 3.6
# ==================================
#
# New Python major version (3.X) break ABI and bytecode compatibility,
# so all packages depending on it need to be rebuilt.
#
# Due to a dependency cycle between Python, gdb, rpm, pip, setuptools, wheel,
# and other packages, this isn't straightforward.
# Build in the following order:
#
# 1. At the same time:
#     - gdb without python support (add %%global _without_python 1 on top of
#       gdb's SPEC file)
#     - python-rpm-generators with bootstrapping_python set to 1
#       (this can be done also during step 2., but should be done before 3.)
# 2. python3 without rewheel (use %%bcond_with rewheel instead of
#     %%bcond_without)
# 3. At the same time:
#     - gdb with python support (remove %%global _without_python 1 on top of
#       gdb's SPEC file)
#     - python-rpm-generators with bootstrapping_python set to 0
#       (this can be done at any later step without negative effects)
# 4. rpm
# 5. python-setuptools with bootstrap set to 1
# 6. python-pip with build_wheel set to 0
# 7. python-wheel with %%bcond_without bootstrap
# 8. python-setuptools with bootstrap set to 0 and also with_check set to 0
# 9. python-pip with build_wheel set to 1
# 10. pyparsing
# 11. python3 with rewheel
#
# Then the most important packages have to be built, in dependency order.
# These were:
#   python-sphinx, pytest, python-requests, cloud-init, dnf, anaconda, abrt
#
# After these have been built, a targeted rebuild should be done for the rest.

# invoked without an argument thus using the wrong version of python3
# (/usr/bin/python3.6, rather than the freshly built python3), thus leading to
# numerous syntax errors, and incorrect magic numbers in the .pyc files.  We

  /usr/lib/rpm/brp-strip-comment-note %{__strip} %{__objdump} \

# to remove the invocation of brp-python-bytecompile, whilst keeping the
# invocation of brp-python-hardlink (since this should still work for python3
# pyc files)

# For multilib support, files that are different between 32- and 64-bit arches
# need different filenames. Use "64" or "32" according to the word size.

%description
Python is an accessible, high-level, dynamically typed, interpreted programming
language, designed with an emphasis on code readability.
It includes an extensive standard library, and has a vast ecosystem of
third-party libraries.

The %{name} package provides the "python3" executable: the reference
interpreter for the Python language, version 3.
The majority of its standard library is provided in the %{name}-libs package,
which should be installed automatically along with %{name}.
The remaining parts of the Python standard library are broken out into the
%{name}-tkinter and %{name}-test packages, which may need to be installed
separately.

Documentation for Python is provided in the %{name}-docs package.

Packages containing additional libraries for Python are generally named with
the "%{name}-" prefix.

interpreter) with colorizing of code input, output, and error messages;
multi-window text editor with multiple undo, Python colorizing,
smart indent, call tips, auto completion, and other features;
search within any window, replace within editor windows, and
search through multiple files (grep); debugger with persistent
breakpoints, stepping, and viewing of global and local namespaces;
configuration, browsers, and other dialogs.

%description tkinter
The Tkinter (Tk interface) library is a graphical user interface toolkit for
the Python programming language.


%package test

Requires: %{name} = %{version}-%{release}

%description test
The self-test suite for the Python interpreter.

This is only useful to test Python itself. For testing general Python code,
you should use the unittest module from %{name}-libs, or a library such as
%{name}-pytest or %{name}-nose.

# /usr/bin/python3-debug was moved from here:
Obsoletes: python34-debug < 3.4.9-3
%endif

%description debug
python3-debug provides a version of the Python runtime with numerous debugging
features enabled, aimed at advanced Python users such as developers of Python
extension modules.

This version uses more memory and will be slower than the regular Python build,
but is useful for tracking down reference-counting issues and other bugs.

The bytecode format is unchanged, so that .pyc files are compatible between
this and the standard version of Python, but the debugging features mean that
C/C++ extension modules are ABI-incompatible and must be built for each version
separately.

The debug build shares installation directories with the standard Python
runtime, so that .py and .pyc files can be shared.
Compiled extension modules use a special ABI flag ("d") in the filename,
so extensions for both versions can co-exist in the same directory.

# We put the debug-gdb.py file inside /usr/lib/debug to avoid noise from ldconfig
# See https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=562980
#
# The /usr/lib/rpm/redhat/macros defines %%__debug_package to use
# debugfiles.list, and it appears that everything below /usr/lib/debug and
# (/usr/src/debug) gets added to this file (via LISTFILES) in
# /usr/lib/rpm/find-debuginfo.sh
#
# Hence by installing it below /usr/lib/debug we ensure it is added to the
# -debuginfo subpackage
# (if it doesn't, then the rpmbuild ought to fail since the debug-gdb.py
# payload file would be unpackaged)

# Workaround for https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1476593

- drop itertools, operator and _collections modules from the manifests as py3k
commit r84058 moved these inside libpython; json/tests moved to test/json_tests
- move turtle code into the tkinter subpackage

* Wed Nov 17 2010 David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com> - 3.2-0.5.a1
- fix sysconfig to not rely on the -devel subpackage (rhbz#653058)

* Thu Sep  9 2010 David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com> - 3.2-0.4.a1
- move most of the content of the core package to the libs subpackage, given
that the libs aren't meaningfully usable without the standard libraries

* Wed Sep  8 2010 David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com> - 3.2-0.3.a1
- Move test.support to core package (rhbz#596258)

- 3.2a1; add alphatag
- rework %%files in the light of PEP 3147 (__pycache__)
- drop our configuration patch to Setup.dist (patch 0): setup.py should do a
better job of things, and the %%files explicitly lists our modules (r82746
appears to break the old way of doing things).  This leads to various modules
changing from "foomodule.so" to "foo.so".  It also leads to the optimized build
dropping the _sha1, _sha256 and _sha512 modules, but these are provided by
_hashlib; _weakref becomes a builtin module; xxsubtype goes away (it's only for
testing/devel purposes)
- fixup patches 3, 4, 6, 8, 102, 103, 105, 111 for the rebase

plus CVE-2010-1634 and CVE-2010-2089), 109 (CVE-2008-5983)
- add machinery for rebuilding "configure" and friends, using the correct
version of autoconf (patch 300)
- patch the debug build's usage of COUNT_ALLOCS to be less verbose (patch 125)
- "modulator" was removed upstream
- drop "-b" from patch applications affecting .py files to avoid littering the
installation tree

(patch 104); enable them and the WITH_TSC option within the debug build

* Mon May 24 2010 David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com> - 3.1.2-6
- build and install two different configurations of Python 3: debug and
standard, packaging the debug build in a new "python3-debug" subpackage
(patch 103)

* Tue Apr 13 2010 David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com> - 3.1.2-5

- fix typo in libpython.stp (rhbz:575336)

* Fri Mar 12 2010 David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com> - 3.1.1-27
- add pyfuntop.stp example (source 7)

- move the -gdb.py file from %%{_libdir}/INSTSONAME-gdb.py to
%%{_prefix}/lib/debug/%%{_libdir}/INSTSONAME.debug-gdb.py to avoid noise from

debuginfo subpackage, rather than the libs subpackage

configure script, and to avoid fragile scripts that try to figure this out
dynamically (e.g. for the -gdb.py change)

* Mon Feb  8 2010 David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com> - 3.1.1-23
- add gdb hooks for easier debugging (Source 4)

configuration in Modules/Setup.dist, so that the curses modules are built using
setup.py with the downstream default (linking against libncursesw.so, rather
than libncurses.so), rather than within the Makefile; add a test to %%install
to verify the dso files that the curses module is linked against the correct

- update patch0's setup of the crypt module to link it against libcrypt
- update patch0 to comment "datetimemodule" back out, so that it is built
